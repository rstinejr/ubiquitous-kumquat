# ubiquitous-kumquat
## Compute variance in Clojure

Work on simple stat formula.

Clearly, if you want to compute variance, you'd use an existing function.  The goal of this project is to experiment with using reduce in lieu of loop, and to get my feet wet playing with Clojure math functions.

To build and run the project,

1. If you have not done so already, download and install *lein*, see [leiningen.org](http://leiningen.org/)
2. ```git clone git@github.com:rstinejr/ubiquitous-kumquat.git```
3. ```cd ubiquitous-kumquat```
4. ```lein test```
